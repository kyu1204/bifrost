# Bifrost API Gateway

Welcome to the Bifrost API Gateway, an integral part of the Asgard Project. As the name suggests, Bifrost serves as the bridge to connect you with the diverse array of services offered within the Asgard ecosystem.

## Features

1. **Dynamic Route Registration & Management**: Seamlessly integrate your services by dynamically registering routes. Easily manage and modify these routes as your project evolves.
   
2. **Proxy to Registered Routes**: With Bifrost, your requests are effortlessly proxied to the registered routes, ensuring a unified interface regardless of how many services you're integrating.

## Technical Highlights

- **High Performance**: Bifrost is crafted using the Rust programming language, known for its performance and safety guarantees.

- **Asynchronous Communication**: We use Warp, a powerful web framework for Rust, to ensure asynchronous HTTP communications. This ensures efficient utilization of resources and faster response times.

## Getting Started

More detailed documentation on setting up and using Bifrost will be coming soon. For now, you can start by exploring the codebase and familiarizing yourself with its architecture.
